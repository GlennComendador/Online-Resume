              Hi! I am <strong>Glenn Comendador</strong> and I am a Software
              Engineer from the Philippines. I am an experienced manager, looking to restart my career in the world of Software Development. For the past year, I have invested in gaining new knowledge and modern technologies that are applicable in today's development work such as <strong> HTML, CSS, </strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong>. On top of that, I have knowledge and proficiency in <strong>Java and SQL</strong> and that I value clean and readable code. Outside of work, I enjoy travelling locally and internationally, playing drums and video games, and learning new things that can further improve my career and my personal skills.

From simple programs to entertaining games, I compiled and organized them which can be accessed in my <a href="https://github.com/GlennComendador" target="_blank">GitHub Profile</a>

          <div class="project-separation">

            <p><strong>Guess The Number</strong> was developed as a project from a udemy instructor. It's primary focus is to demonstrate my <strong>Javascript</strong> skills. To enhance the initial version of the project, I added difficulty settings, which lessens the chance of attaining a high score, and an instruction modal to guide the users. Additional modifications on the <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> Files were done.</p>
